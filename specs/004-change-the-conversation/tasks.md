# Tasks: Per-Character Conversation History

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-change-the-conversation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/websocket-events.md

**Tests**: Unit and integration tests are included for validation of conversation history management.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Repository root: `/Users/nicolasrabault/Projects/AI_game/audio-game/`
- Source code: `unmute/`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/`
- Tests: `tests/`

---

## Phase 0: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Review existing code and prepare development environment

- [ ] T001 Review existing `Chatbot` class in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to understand current conversation history management
- [ ] T002 [P] Review `UnmuteHandler` in `unmute/unmute_handler.py` to understand session lifecycle and character switching
- [ ] T003 [P] Review WebSocket event handling in `unmute/main_websocket.py` to understand `session.update` flow
- [ ] T004 [P] Review existing metrics in `unmute/metrics.py` to understand instrumentation patterns

**Checkpoint**: Development environment ready, existing code understood

---

## Phase 1: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data structures that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Add new Prometheus metrics to `unmute/metrics.py`: CHARACTER_SWITCH_COUNT (counter with from_character/to_character labels), CHARACTER_SWITCH_DURATION (histogram with buckets [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0]), CHARACTER_HISTORY_SIZE (gauge with character label), CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS (counter with character/reason labels), CHARACTER_HISTORIES_PER_SESSION (gauge), CHARACTER_HISTORY_TRUNCATIONS (counter with character label)
- [x] T006 [P] Create `CharacterHistory` class in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` with attributes: character_name (str), messages (list[dict]), created_at (float), last_accessed (float)
- [x] T007 [P] Implement `CharacterHistory.__init__(character_name, system_prompt, created_at)` method that initializes with system message
- [x] T008 Implement `CharacterHistory.add_message(message)` method to append messages to history
- [x] T009 Implement `CharacterHistory.truncate_if_needed(max_messages=100)` method with FIFO strategy (keep system prompt + last 99 messages)
- [x] T010 Implement `CharacterHistory.get_system_prompt()` method to return first message content (always system role)
- [x] T011 Implement `CharacterHistory.update_system_prompt(prompt)` method to update first message content
- [x] T012 Add `CharacterHistory.message_count` property that returns len(messages)
- [x] T013 Refactor `Chatbot` class in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py`: add `character_histories: dict[str, CharacterHistory]` attribute, add `current_character: str | None` attribute
- [x] T014 Remove `chat_history` list attribute from `Chatbot.__init__()` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` (replaced by character_histories dict)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - CharacterHistory and Chatbot data structures complete

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Switch Between Characters with Preserved History (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can switch between different characters during an active session, with each character maintaining their own separate conversation history. When switching back to a previously used character, the user sees the complete conversation history from their previous interactions with that character.

**Independent Test**: Start conversation with Character A (3 exchanges), switch to Character B (2 exchanges), switch back to Character A and verify original 3 exchanges are preserved.

### Core Character Switching Implementation

- [x] T015 [US1] Implement `Chatbot.switch_character(character_name, system_prompt)` method in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` that creates/retrieves CharacterHistory, updates current_character, updates last_accessed timestamp, and emits CHARACTER_SWITCH metrics
- [x] T016 [US1] Implement `Chatbot.get_current_history()` method in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` that returns current character's messages list (or default if no character active)
- [x] T017 [US1] ~~Add `Chatbot.chat_history` property for backward compatibility~~ (REMOVED - no backward compatibility per constitution change)
- [x] T018 [US1] Update `Chatbot.add_chat_message_delta()` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to operate on current character's history and call truncate_if_needed() after message additions
- [x] T019 [US1] Update `Chatbot.conversation_state()` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to check current character's last message
- [x] T020 [US1] Update `Chatbot.preprocessed_messages()` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to preprocess current character's messages
- [x] T021 [US1] Update `Chatbot.last_message(role)` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to search current character's history
- [x] T022 [US1] Update `Chatbot.set_prompt_generator(generator)` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to update current character's system prompt
- [x] T023 [US1] Update `Chatbot.get_system_prompt()` in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to return current character's system prompt

### Session Integration

- [x] T024 [US1] Update `UnmuteHandler.update_session()` in `unmute/unmute_handler.py` to call `chatbot.switch_character()` when voice changes (within turn_transition_lock)
- [x] T025 [US1] Ensure character switch uses existing `turn_transition_lock` in `unmute/unmute_handler.py` to prevent race conditions during LLM response generation
- [x] T026 [US1] Add logging in `UnmuteHandler.update_session()` to record character switches with from/to character names
- [x] T027 [US1] Update CHARACTER_HISTORIES_PER_SESSION gauge in `UnmuteHandler.update_session()` after each switch

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T028 [US1] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_character_switch_creates_new_history` to verify first-time switch creates new CharacterHistory
- [ ] T029 [US1] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_character_switch_restores_existing_history` to verify switching back restores previous messages
- [ ] T030 [US1] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_character_histories_are_isolated` to verify message to character A doesn't appear in character B's history
- [ ] T031 [US1] Create integration test `tests/test_character_switching.py::test_switch_preserves_conversation_context` to verify full switch cycle with WebSocket session
- [ ] T032 [US1] Create integration test `tests/test_character_switching.py::test_switch_without_disconnection` to verify session remains connected during switch
- [ ] T033 [US1] Verify CHARACTER_SWITCH_DURATION histogram emits correctly and measures < 100ms for new character, < 50ms for existing character
- [ ] T034 [US1] Manual test: Talk to D√©veloppeuse (3 exchanges), switch to Charles (2 exchanges), switch back to D√©veloppeuse and verify all 3 original exchanges are present

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can switch between characters with preserved histories

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Clear Character-Specific Conversation History (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: A user can selectively clear the conversation history for a specific character without affecting other characters' conversation histories or disconnecting from the session. The trigger mechanism for this action will be determined in a later phase (potentially through character code).

**Independent Test**: Create conversations with multiple characters, call clear function for one character, verify only that character's history is removed while others remain intact.

### Clear Functions Implementation

- [x] T035 [P] [US2] Implement `Chatbot.clear_character_history(character_name)` method in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to remove character from character_histories dict and emit CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS metric
- [x] T036 [P] [US2] Add validation in `Chatbot.clear_character_history()` to handle clearing non-existent character gracefully (log warning, don't raise error)
- [x] T037 [P] [US2] Add logic to handle clearing the currently active character in `Chatbot.clear_character_history()` (set current_character to None if clearing active)
- [x] T038 [US2] Update CHARACTER_HISTORIES_PER_SESSION gauge after clearing character history

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T039 [US2] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_clear_character_removes_only_specified` to verify clearing one character doesn't affect others
- [ ] T040 [US2] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_clear_nonexistent_character_no_error` to verify clearing non-existent character doesn't crash
- [ ] T041 [US2] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_clear_active_character_resets_current` to verify clearing current character sets current_character to None
- [ ] T042 [US2] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_switch_after_clear_creates_fresh_history` to verify switching to cleared character creates fresh history
- [ ] T043 [US2] Verify CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS counter emits correctly with character label and reason="manual"
- [ ] T044 [US2] Manual test: Create histories for 3 characters, call clear_character_history() for middle character, verify session stays connected and other characters unaffected

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - users can switch characters and selectively clear histories

---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Session Disconnection Clears All Histories (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: When a user disconnects from their session, all character-specific conversation histories are cleared, ensuring no persistent memory across sessions.

**Independent Test**: Create conversations with multiple characters, disconnect, reconnect, verify all previous conversation histories are gone.

### Session Cleanup Implementation

- [x] T045 [US3] Implement `Chatbot.clear_all_histories()` method in `unmute/llm/chatbot.py` to iterate over all characters, emit CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS for each, clear character_histories dict, and set current_character to None
- [x] T046 [US3] Add call to `chatbot.clear_all_histories()` in `UnmuteHandler.__aexit__()` in `unmute/unmute_handler.py` (after character_manager cleanup)
- [x] T047 [US3] Add timing measurement around `clear_all_histories()` to verify it completes in < 1 second (per SC-004)
- [x] T048 [US3] Add logging in `UnmuteHandler.__aexit__()` to record number of character histories cleared

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T049 [US3] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_clear_all_removes_all_histories` to verify all characters removed
- [ ] T050 [US3] Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_clear_all_resets_current_character` to verify current_character set to None
- [ ] T051 [US3] Create integration test `tests/test_character_switching.py::test_disconnect_clears_all_histories` to verify WebSocket disconnect triggers cleanup
- [ ] T052 [US3] Create integration test `tests/test_character_switching.py::test_reconnect_has_fresh_histories` to verify reconnecting creates fresh session
- [ ] T053 [US3] Verify CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS counter emits for each character with reason="session_end"
- [ ] T054 [US3] Manual test: Create histories for 3 characters, disconnect, reconnect, switch to each character and verify all have fresh/empty histories

**Checkpoint**: All three user stories should now be independently functional - complete character history management system

---

## Phase 5: Memory Management & Performance

**Purpose**: Implement and validate memory management for long conversations

### Truncation Implementation

- [x] T055 [P] Add constant `MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHARACTER = 100` at top of `unmute/llm/chatbot.py`
- [x] T056 [P] Add call to `truncate_if_needed()` in `Chatbot.add_chat_message_delta()` after message is added/updated
- [x] T057 [P] Emit CHARACTER_HISTORY_TRUNCATIONS counter when truncation occurs (in CharacterHistory.truncate_if_needed())
- [x] T058 [P] Update CHARACTER_HISTORY_SIZE gauge after truncation with new message count

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T059 Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_truncation_at_100_messages` to verify history truncates when exceeding limit
- [ ] T060 Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_truncation_preserves_system_prompt` to verify system prompt always remains after truncation
- [ ] T061 Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_truncation_keeps_recent_messages` to verify last 99 messages retained after truncation
- [ ] T062 Create unit test `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py::test_truncation_returns_correct_count` to verify truncate_if_needed() returns number of messages removed
- [ ] T063 Performance test: Create 150-message conversation, verify truncation occurs correctly and performance remains acceptable
- [ ] T064 Memory test: Create 10 characters with 100 messages each, verify memory usage is ~500KB per session (estimate from data-model.md)

**Checkpoint**: Memory management implemented and validated - system can handle long conversations

---

## Phase 6: Frontend Integration

**Purpose**: Update frontend to support seamless character switching without disconnection

### Frontend Changes

- [x] T065 [P] Review current disconnect behavior in `frontend/src/app/Unmute.tsx` around line 243-248 (useEffect that disconnects on voice change)
- [x] T066 [US1] Remove or comment out disconnect/reconnect behavior in `frontend/src/app/Unmute.tsx` when `unmuteConfig.voice` changes
- [x] T067 [US1] Verify `session.update` event is sent when character changes in character list UI (should already exist from Feature 002)
- [x] T068 [US1] Ensure character list UI correctly highlights active character in green (should already exist from Feature 002)

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] T069 Manual frontend test: Connect, select character from list, verify connection stays open (WebSocket state = OPEN)
- [ ] T070 Manual frontend test: Switch between 3 different characters, verify no disconnections occur
- [ ] T071 Manual frontend test: Verify active character highlighted in green after each switch
- [ ] T072 Integration test: Verify frontend sends session.update event when character clicked (can be tested with browser DevTools)

**Checkpoint**: Frontend supports seamless character switching without disconnections

---

## Phase 7: Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Purpose**: Handle edge cases and error scenarios robustly

### Edge Case Handling

- [x] T073 [P] Add error handling in `UnmuteHandler.update_session()` for character not found in character_manager (log error, keep current character)
- [x] T074 [P] Add error handling in `Chatbot.switch_character()` for invalid/empty character names (log error, don't switch)
- [x] T075 Add test for switching characters while LLM response is in progress (verify turn_transition_lock blocks switch until response completes)
- [x] T076 Add test for rapid consecutive character switches (verify each completes correctly)
- [x] T077 Add test for switching to a character that was previously cleared (verify fresh history created)
- [x] T078 Add test for message addition when no current character is set (verify graceful handling)

### Error Response Events (Future Extensions)

- [x] T079 Document error event structure for "character_not_found" in contracts/websocket-events.md (already documented, verify completeness)
- [x] T080 Document error event structure for "character_switch_failed" in contracts/websocket-events.md (already documented, verify completeness)

**Checkpoint**: System handles edge cases gracefully without crashes

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (pytest)

**File**: `tests/test_chatbot_character_history.py`

- CharacterHistory class: creation, message addition, truncation, system prompt management
- Chatbot class: character switching, history isolation, backward compatibility, clearing

**File**: `tests/test_character_switching.py`

- Integration tests: WebSocket session with character switches
- Session lifecycle: disconnect cleanup, reconnect fresh state

### Manual Tests

**Test Scenarios** (from quickstart.md):

1. **Basic Character Switch**: Talk to D√©veloppeuse ‚Üí Switch to Charles ‚Üí Verify fresh history
2. **History Preservation**: Talk to A ‚Üí Switch to B ‚Üí Switch back to A ‚Üí Verify A's history preserved
3. **History Clearing**: Create 3 character histories ‚Üí Clear one ‚Üí Verify others unaffected
4. **Session Disconnect**: Create 3 character histories ‚Üí Disconnect ‚Üí Reconnect ‚Üí Verify all cleared
5. **Memory Management**: Create 150-message conversation ‚Üí Verify truncation at 100
6. **Performance**: Switch 10 times ‚Üí Verify < 2s per switch
7. **Frontend**: Switch via UI ‚Üí Verify no disconnection

### Performance Tests

- Character switch latency (target: <2s, expected: <100ms)
- History clearing latency (target: <1s)
- Memory usage with 10 characters √ó 100 messages (target: ~500KB)
- No degradation with multiple character histories

---

## Metrics to Monitor

### During Implementation

- `CHARACTER_SWITCH_COUNT` - Should increment on each switch
- `CHARACTER_SWITCH_DURATION` - Should show <100ms for most switches
- `CHARACTER_HISTORY_SIZE` - Should track message counts per character
- `CHARACTER_HISTORY_CLEARS` - Should increment on clear operations
- `CHARACTER_HISTORIES_PER_SESSION` - Should show number of active characters
- `CHARACTER_HISTORY_TRUNCATIONS` - Should increment when history exceeds 100 messages

### Production Monitoring

After deployment, monitor these metrics to ensure:

- Switch duration stays < 2s (SC-001)
- No unexpected errors during switches
- Memory usage stays reasonable
- History truncations occur as expected

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/areas, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [US1]/[US2]/[US3] labels map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- User Story 1 is the MVP - delivers core value (character switching with preserved history)
- User Story 2 adds control (selective clearing)
- User Story 3 ensures privacy (session cleanup)
- Memory management (Phase 5) can overlap with US2/US3
- Frontend changes (Phase 6) are minimal - just remove disconnect behavior
- Constitution compliance: No TTS/LLM/STT changes, all async operations, metrics instrumented
- Backward compatibility maintained via `chat_history` property delegation

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 96
- **Phase 0 (Setup)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 1 (Foundational)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 2 (User Story 1)**: 20 tasks
- **Phase 3 (User Story 2)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 4 (User Story 3)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 5 (Memory Management)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 6 (Frontend Integration)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Edge Cases)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 16 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~30 tasks marked [P] can run concurrently with other tasks in their phase

**MVP Scope**: Phases 0-2 + Phase 6 (42 tasks) deliver User Story 1 + Frontend, which provides core character switching with preserved histories

**Independent Test Criteria**:

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk                                  | Mitigation Tasks                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Memory growth with long conversations | T055-T064 (truncation at 100 msg) |
| Race conditions during switch         | T025, T075 (turn_transition_lock) |
| History corruption                    | T030, T093 (isolation tests)      |
| Frontend state sync issues            | T069-T072 (manual frontend tests) |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk                           | Mitigation Tasks                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Breaking existing conversation | T017 (backward compat), T090 (testing) |
| Performance degradation        | T033, T064, T094-T095 (perf tests)     |
| Unclear clearing UX (deferred) | T035-T038 (implement function anyway)  |
