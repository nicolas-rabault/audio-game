# Specification Quality Checklist: Optional TOOLS Variable for Character Function Calling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - NOTE: Some technical details present but appropriate for developer-focused feature
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Users are character developers who need extensibility
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Written for technical stakeholders (character developers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Revised to be more outcome-focused
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Acceptable level for developer-focused feature

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-17

All checklist items pass. This is a developer-focused feature (character developers extending character capabilities), so some technical terminology is appropriate. Success criteria have been revised to focus on outcomes rather than implementation details.

## Notes

- Feature is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Target users are character developers (technical stakeholders), not end users
- Specification balances business value (extensibility, backward compatibility) with necessary technical context
