# Specification Quality Checklist: Self-Contained Character Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains business/user focus throughout:
- User stories describe character designer and system administrator personas
- Requirements focus on "what" (self-contained files, folder-based loading) not "how"
- No mention of specific Python classes, frameworks, or implementation patterns
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and testable:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each FR has clear acceptance criteria via user story scenarios
- Success criteria include concrete metrics (50+ characters in <5 seconds, 100% migration success, 20% error tolerance)
- Success criteria are user/business focused (independent manageability, zero data loss, graceful degradation)
- All 3 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases comprehensively cover malformed files, duplicates, missing files, and unknown fields
- "Out of Scope" section clearly bounds the feature
- Dependencies and Constraints sections identify key limitations

### Feature Readiness
✅ **PASS** - Specification is ready for planning:
- FR-001 through FR-013 map directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories (P1: bank loading, P1: self-contained files, P2: migration) cover all critical flows
- Success criteria align with functional requirements and user value
- No implementation leakage detected

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification:
- Maintains clear separation between requirements (what) and implementation (how)
- Provides testable acceptance criteria for all user stories
- Defines measurable success criteria
- Identifies all necessary dependencies and constraints
- Clearly scopes included and excluded functionality

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to begin technical design.

**No follow-up actions required.**
