# Specification Quality Checklist: Per-Session Character Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of Python, FastAPI, importlib, etc.)
- ✅ Focus is on user value: multi-user isolation, session independence, dynamic reloading
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable
  - Example: FR-001 "System MUST maintain separate character registries" can be tested by verifying two sessions see different characters
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
  - SC-001: "at least 10 concurrent users"
  - SC-002: "under 2 seconds for directories with up to 20 characters"
  - SC-003: "zero observable impact"
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes like "users can reload", "no observable impact")
- ✅ All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively identified (7 edge cases covering error conditions, concurrency, invalid states)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows (P1: isolation, P2: dynamic reloading, P3: persistence)
- ✅ Feature deliverables align with success criteria
- ✅ No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value around multi-user isolation
- Provides testable requirements without prescribing implementation
- Includes measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Identifies comprehensive edge cases and dependencies
- Maintains focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
