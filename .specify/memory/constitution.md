# Audio Game Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Service Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The TTS (Text-to-Speech), LLM (Large Language Model), and STT (Speech-to-Text) services are **production-stable external dependencies** and MUST NOT be modified, replaced, or reimplemented as part of feature development.

**Rules**:

- All three services (TTS, LLM, STT) are treated as black-box external APIs
- Changes to integration code (handlers, queue management, protocol adapters) are permitted
- Service configuration (URLs, models, parameters) may be adjusted via environment variables
- New features MUST work with existing service interfaces without requiring service modifications
- If a service limitation is discovered, document it and design around it—do not attempt to fix the service

**Rationale**: These services represent mature, performance-optimized components. Maintaining their stability ensures predictable latency characteristics and reduces system complexity. Integration work happens at boundaries, not within services.

### II. Performance Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature that affects the audio pipeline, user interaction timing, or service integration MUST include performance benchmarking using the loadtest framework before being considered complete.

**Rules**:

- Performance tests MUST measure latency distributions (mean, median, p90, p95) for affected components
- Loadtest MUST use realistic audio samples and multi-worker scenarios (minimum 4 workers for integration tests)
- Test results MUST include:
  - STT latency (time from audio_start to text_start)
  - VAD latency (time from audio_end to response_created)
  - LLM latency (time from response_created to text_start)
  - TTS start latency (time from text_start to audio_start)
  - TTS realtime factor (received_audio_length / generation_time)
- Performance regressions >10% from baseline require explicit justification and approval
- All performance tests run with `--n-workers` ≥ 4 to simulate concurrent load

**Rationale**: This project is latency-sensitive by nature. The loadtest framework (`unmute/loadtest/loadtest_client.py`) provides comprehensive timing measurement across all pipeline stages. Real-time audio interaction requires sub-second response times, making performance testing non-negotiable.

### III. Latency Budgets

All components MUST operate within defined latency budgets derived from production metrics bins. Violations of these budgets require architectural review.

**Target Latencies** (p95, based on metrics.py bins):

- **STT First Token**: <100ms (TTFT_BINS_STT_MS)
- **TTS First Token**: <550ms (TTFT_BINS_TTS_MS)
- **LLM First Token**: <500ms (TTFT_BINS_VLLM_MS)
- **User Turn Duration**: <60s (TURN_DURATION_BINS)
- **TTS Realtime Factor**: >1.0 (audio generation must be faster than playback)

**Frame-Level Constraints**:

- Sample rate: 24000 Hz (SAMPLE_RATE constant)
- Frame size: 1920 samples (SAMPLES_PER_FRAME constant)
- Frame time: 80ms (FRAME_TIME_SEC constant)
- STT delay budget: 500ms (STT_DELAY_SEC constant)

**Rationale**: These budgets emerge from production Prometheus metrics and represent user-perceptible quality thresholds. The frame-level constraints in `kyutai_constants.py` define physical timing limits of the audio pipeline.

### IV. Async-First Architecture

All I/O-bound operations and service interactions MUST use async/await patterns. Blocking operations are prohibited in the main event loop.

**Rules**:

- Use `asyncio.Queue` for inter-task communication (see `output_queue` in `UnmuteHandler`)
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` for concurrent operations (see emit/receive loops in loadtest)
- Use `Stopwatch` and `PhasesStopwatch` from `timer.py` for timing measurements within async contexts
- Long-running blocking operations MUST be offloaded to thread/process pools (see multiprocessing in loadtest)
- WebSocket connections use async context managers (`async with websockets.connect()`)

**Rationale**: Real-time audio streaming requires non-blocking concurrency. The system handles multiple simultaneous audio streams, WebSocket connections, and service calls. Async architecture is essential for meeting latency budgets and maintaining throughput under concurrent load.

### V. Observability & Metrics

All production code paths MUST emit Prometheus metrics for monitoring. Changes affecting user flows require corresponding metric updates.

**Required Metrics Categories** (from `metrics.py`):

- **Counters**: Sessions, errors, interrupts, frames sent/received
- **Histograms**: Latencies (TTFT), durations (session, turn, generation), request/response sizes
- **Gauges**: Active sessions per service (STT, TTS, LLM)

**Mandatory Instrumentation Points**:

- Service connection attempts and failures (e.g., `STT_MISSES`, `TTS_HARD_MISSES`)
- Time-to-first-token for all streaming services (e.g., `STT_TTFT`, `TTS_TTFT`, `VLLM_TTFT`)
- Session lifecycle events (start, end, duration)
- Audio processing metrics (frames sent/received, audio duration)

**Rationale**: Production observability is not optional. The metrics bins defined in `metrics.py` represent operational knowledge about system behavior. Instrumentation must happen at development time, not as an afterthought.

### VI. Clean Break Evolution (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

When modifying existing functionality, the old implementation MUST be completely removed from code, data structures, and documentation. Backward compatibility layers are explicitly prohibited.

**Rules**:

- When changing an API, protocol, or data format, remove all traces of the old version
- Old code paths, feature flags for deprecated features, and compatibility shims MUST be deleted
- Documentation MUST reflect only the current implementation (no "legacy" or "deprecated" sections)
- Data migration MUST be one-way: convert old data to new format and delete migration code afterward
- Configuration files MUST NOT contain unused legacy parameters
- When renaming functions, variables, or modules, update all references—do not keep aliases

**Rationale**: Maintaining backward compatibility creates technical debt that accumulates over time. Multiple code paths for the same functionality increase cognitive load, complicate testing, and obscure the canonical way to accomplish tasks. Clean breaks force intentional design decisions and keep the codebase maintainable. In a rapidly evolving system with real-time latency constraints, clarity and simplicity are more valuable than backward compatibility.

## Performance Standards

### Latency Measurement Protocol

All latency measurements MUST use the standardized timing framework:

1. **User Message Timing** (`UserMessageTiming`):

   - `audio_start`: When user audio begins
   - `text_start`: When STT emits first transcription token
   - `audio_end`: When user audio ends

2. **Assistant Message Timing** (`AssistantMessageTiming`):
   - `response_created`: When LLM response generation starts
   - `text_start`: When LLM emits first text token
   - `audio_start`: When TTS emits first audio chunk
   - `audio_end`: When TTS completes audio generation
   - `received_audio_length`: Total audio duration (for realtime factor calculation)

### Testing Discipline

**Unit Tests** (pytest):

- Pure functions MUST have unit tests with clear input/output examples
- See `tests/test_llm_utils.py` for async iterator testing patterns
- See `tests/test_exponential_moving_average.py` for numerical algorithm testing patterns
- Use `pytest.approx()` for floating-point comparisons

**Integration Tests** (loadtest framework):

- End-to-end pipeline tests MUST use `loadtest_client.py`
- Test with diverse audio samples from `loadtest/voices/` directory
- Multi-worker tests (`--n-workers`) are mandatory for concurrency validation
- Results MUST be analyzed for distribution statistics (not just mean values)

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Specification**: Define user scenarios with performance acceptance criteria
2. **Design**: Identify affected services and integration boundaries
3. **Constitution Check**: Verify compliance with service isolation and latency budgets
4. **Implementation**: Develop with async patterns and metrics instrumentation
5. **Performance Validation**: Run loadtest with baseline comparison
6. **Review**: Verify metrics coverage and latency budget compliance

### Code Quality Gates

- All async functions MUST handle `CloseStream` signals for graceful shutdown
- All service clients MUST implement exponential backoff for retries (see `ExponentialMovingAverage`)
- All WebSocket handlers MUST implement ping/health check mechanisms
- All audio processing MUST respect frame boundaries (SAMPLES_PER_FRAME)

### Documentation Requirements

- Performance-critical code MUST include inline comments explaining timing constraints
- Service integration points MUST document expected latency characteristics
- Configuration changes MUST update corresponding environment variable documentation
